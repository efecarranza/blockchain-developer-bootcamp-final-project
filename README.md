# Project Idea

Create a betting site where one can bet on specific metrics such as: the price of Ethereum at X date, the market cap ranking of a coin at X date, etc.
The funds cannot be withdrawn from the contract so that they are kept to distribute to bettors.
The book can be made and updated by the main entity.

I guess there is a main contract that can be accessed only by the manager, and that creates smaller contracts per bet.
